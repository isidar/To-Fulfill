		<key>title</key>
		<string>The two of us were the closest people to each other for almost 2 years. Without dating, we built relationship full of support, joy and hope.

On October 18 we`ve realized that something between us was broken: for some period of time we were experiencing offence, the lack of personal space and awkward moments in communication. In order to finish our relationships with dignity, we collected a list of questions for each other, met and listened carefully. 

With these questions, magic has happened: together we could pass the period full of misunderstandings and anger.

We are not psychologists. We are just people who don`t want to leave both of you with unanswered questions.

Yours, Diana and Alla.</string>
